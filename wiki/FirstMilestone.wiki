= Introduction =

Here is a description of things which need further development for the guiFunctionality Milestone. This milestone will simply be a GUI which basically allows the user to see what the game would look like and to navigate away from the main menu and see when *attack window*. The attack window consists of two grids - one which will be the _Targeting Screen_ and the other _Status Screen_. The _Status Screen_ will be the user's interface for placing their ships, while the _Targeting Screen_ will be the interface for dropping bombs on the enemy.

== Things to do:==

  *  Assign Tasks to each person. i.e. figure out something to do for yourself and tell me what your doing 

  *  Also when you start something add an issue report

==== Menu ====
  #  Create main title
  #  Incorporate an animating pic into the background
  #  Make only the *Single player* button work - others display an error
    *  Figure out what error should say

==== Attack Window (_GameState_) ====
  #  Have Pictures of each boat on side
    *  Enable the pictures to be able to be _draged_ to a position on grid
    *  Enable boats to be able to be draged between grid positions
  #  Have button to _set_ the positions - ie make it permanent and start game
  #  Have a animating pic in background

== Pics ==

==== Background ====
  *  Background pic should be water-ish stuff

==== Boats ====
  *  Aircraft carrier - takes up 5 grid spaces
  *  BattleShip - 4 grid spaces
  *  Sub - 3 grid spaces
  *  UBoat (small scout thing) - 2 spaces
